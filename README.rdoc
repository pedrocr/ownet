= ownet

This is a simple client-side implementation of the owserver protocol from the owfs project. It allows you to query any owserver over the network (or locally).

== Usage

To test actually using the connection run owserver with fake sensors:

  owserver --fake 1F,10

And now list the contents of the root dir:

  require 'ownet'
  conn = OWNet::Connection.new
  conn.dir('/')
  #=> ["/1F.67C6697351FF", "/10.4AEC29CDBAAB", "/bus.0", "/uncached" ...

To read a value do:

  conn.read('/10.4AEC29CDBAAB/temperature')
  #=> 36.4784 (Returns a random value with owserver --fake)

To write a value do:
  
  conn.write('/1F.67C6697351FF/clearevent', 1)
  #=> 0
