= ownet

This is a simple client-side implementation of the owserver protocol from the owfs project. It allows you to query any owserver over the network (or locally).

== Usage

Create a new connection. The default is to connect to localhost on port 4304. opts can contain a server and a port. For example:
  
  #Connect to a remote server on the default port:
  Connection.new(:server=>"my.server.com")

  #Connect to a local server on a non-standard port:
  Connection.new(:port=>20200)

  #Connect to a remote server on a non-standard port:
  Connection.new(:server=>"my.server.com", :port=>20200)
